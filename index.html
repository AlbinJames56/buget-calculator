                    <div class="green-line"></div>
                    <p class=" mt-3">If you’re in debt, save $1,000 in a starter emergency fund. Then pause saving and focus on paying off that debt. Once you’re debt-free, save up 3–6 months of expenses for a fully funded emergency fund. These are the first three of the 7 Baby Steps, and taking each of these steps one at a time is how you make real progress with your money goals. </p>

                    <p class=" mt-3"> Food is the easiest budget line to bust—and the hardest to plan for that first month. Open your bank account and see about how much you spent on food last month. You can tweak this number in EveryDollar as you budget (and learn more about) your spending here!</p>

                    <p class=" mt-3">Utilities are the essential expenses that keep your house running. The amounts can change, but check your bank account and see what you spent last month on electricity, water, the phone bill, natural gas, etc. Add those up and start with that number here. </p>

                    <p class="mt-3">Pro tip: When you spend 25% (or less) of your take-home pay on housing (mortgage or rent plus insurance, property taxes and HOA fees), one of your biggest blessings (your home) won’t turn into a financial burden. </p>

                    <div class="green-line"></div>
                    <p class=" mt-3">Look back through your bank account and add up how much you spent on gas last month as a starting number for this category. Then don’t forget auto insurance, maintenance, and anything else you spend on transportation.  </p>

                    <p class=" mt-3"> You planned for homeowners/renters and auto coverage in other categories. Here, add what you spend on other insurances you need: term life, health, long-term disability, long-term care (if you’re age 60+), identity theft, and umbrella (if you’ve got a net worth of $500,000 or more).</p>

                    <p class=" mt-3">Debt is any money you owe to anyone for any reason. So, add up all your car payments, credit card bills, student loans, medical debt and other payment plans and put that total here. Then start hustling to pay it off and really make progress with your money.</p>
